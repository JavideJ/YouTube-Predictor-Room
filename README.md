## Machine learning web app to predict the channel, likes or views from a YouTube video

Just pass the url of a video and the number of dislikes. To know the number of dislikes I recommend to install the "Return Youtube Dislike" Chrome extension.
The channel prediction will work only with the following ones: elxokas, Willyrex, aLexBY11, elrubiusOMG (plus Rubius Z), Luisito Comunica, JuegaGerman, VEGETTA777, LOLiTO FDEZ, luzugames and TheGrefg. If you pass a video from other channel, it will predict to which channel it resembles.
Likes and views predictions will work for every channel, but it will perform better if the channel is similar to one of the ten from the list.
